image stitching in Simple CV

SimpleCV is required to run. Get it here: https://github.com/sightmachine/simplecv

To stitch together images
  1) Run "python imagestitch.py"
  2) Select whether you are stitching 2 images or more. At the moment only 4 images are supported and it will stitch them assuming they form a square.
  3) Follow instructions
  4) Wait and open stitched.jpg

This is a work in progress...
